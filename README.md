# [GX Hacker](https://github.com/gx-hacker) (GXH) Projects Archive Home

Welcome to this project! This is an archive of some browser styles and Discord themes! Most of them are reuploaded from "Discord Addons", an older project that got unfortunately deleted.

## Wanna try?

Here are the repos you should check to get started here!

### - [Discord themes](https://github.com/gx-hacker/discord-themes)

### - [Browser styles](https://github.com/gx-hacker/browser-styles)

You can see all the repositories on [my account](https://github.com/gx-hacker)!

## Want help?

Personal support may not be available because this is an archive, and the repo owner is no longer using their account.

## Want to contribute?

The source code for most things is available in the [source](https://github.com/gx-hacker/source) repo. You can use this for anything such as your copy of this project. Don't hesitate to publish updated/improved versions of the project!

### You may check the [license](https://github.com/GX-Hacker/home/blob/main/LICENSE.md) before anything!

*(Keep in mind that you didn't "create" copied stuff from a source that is not yours!)*
