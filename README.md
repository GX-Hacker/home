# GX Hacker home repo

Welcome to this brand new project! GX Hacker contains many available browser styles and Discord themes! Most of them are reuploaded from "Discord Addons", a project that got sadly deleted (unfortunately).

## Wanna try?

Here are the repos you should check to get started here!

### - [Discord themes](https://github.com/gx-hacker/discord-themes)

### - [Browser styles](https://github.com/gx-hacker/browser-styles)

You can see all the repositories on [my account](https://github.com/gx-hacker)!

## Want help?

Newbies may not know how to download and use a Discord theme or browser style. Everything is explained on the [wiki](https://github.com/gx-hacker/home/wiki)!

You can also [join my Discord server](https://dsc.gg/code-and-stuff) if you have any question!

## Want to contribute?

The source code for most things is available in the [source](https://github.com/gx-hacker/source) repo. You can make pull requests, report issues, anything helpful. Any help is really appreciated!
