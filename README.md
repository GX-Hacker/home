*I don't want "Discord Addons" to die, I want it to have a future, because this project took time to create, and it had great content to share with people. I also want people to continue enjoying the themes and styles they used to love. That's why I want to be the new responsible of this content, keep things alive, and even try to make them better.* - me

Welcome to my project! I have some interesting browser styles and Discord themes! Most of them are reuploaded from "Discord Addons", an older project that got unfortunately deleted.

## Wanna try?

Here are the repos you should check to get started here!

### - [Discord themes](https://github.com/gx-hacker/discord-themes)

### - [Browser styles](https://github.com/gx-hacker/browser-styles)

You can see all the repositories on [my account](https://github.com/gx-hacker)!

## Want help?

Newbies may not know how to download and use a Discord theme, a browser style or whatever. Everything is explained on the [wiki](https://github.com/gx-hacker/home/wiki)! You can also click the "Wiki" tab from any repository like this one.

For direct help or questions that aren't answered, [join my Discord server](https://dsc.gg/code-and-stuff)!

## Want to contribute?

The source code for most things is available in the [source](https://github.com/gx-hacker/source) repo. You can make pull requests, report issues, anything helpful. Any help is really appreciated!
