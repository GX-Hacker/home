# Project License

Maintained on the GX Hacker (gx-hacker) account.

GX Hacker has not "created" all the copied content, but it maintains them (credits to "Discord Addons"... well, sadly deleted), and any rights is reserved. GX Hacker owns its own originally created content and modified parts of source code.

Here you will read about public permissions, about what you can and can't do with this project.

## What you CAN do:

- Use this project and copies of this project.
- Share sources of this project.
- Modify this project like you want for personal use.
- Create and publish modified copies with different names if you'd like to, mentioning [GX Hacker](https://github.com/gx-hacker) somewhere publicly visible.
- Help in any way, make pull requests for example!

## What you can NOT do:

- Make anything related to this project ***paid*** (will be considered as ***scam***). Everything may be 100% free.
- Make a distrubing or fake advertisement of this project.
- Any other obvious ways that people shouldn't do.

## Responsibility

The reuploaded content from "Discord Addons" is currently considered as "Discord Addons unofficial source", because it is a modified copy of its content. GX Hacker manages the code by themself, and this, separately.

*From the original license: "Please note that Discord Addons is not responsible of modified versions nor unofficial sources of its content and you must manage them by yourself."*

We will try to contact any Discord Addons responsible (if possible) to see if this copy could be considered as something like "official/approved source" so you can still trust an official source of nice content. *If any of them reads that, please contact us privately for your confirmation, that would be a lot easier.*

You can create modified copies of this project, so please credit us if you do it. Like Discord Addons did, GX Hacker is not responsible of any copy of its content.
