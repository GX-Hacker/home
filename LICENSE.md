# GXH Project License

Maintained on the [GX Hacker (gx-hacker)](https://github.com/GX-Hacker) GitHub account.

GX Hacker did not "create" all the reuploaded content, but continues to maintain them (credits to "Discord Addons"... well, sadly deleted), and any rights are reserved. GX Hacker owns its own originally written code and modified parts of the code.

Here you will learn about public permissions, about what you can and can't do with this project.

## What you CAN do:

- Use this project and copies of this project.
- Share redirections of this project.
- Copy and modify this project for personal use.
- Create and publish modified copies with different names if you'd like to, mentioning [GXH Projects](https://github.com/gx-hacker/home) or [GX Hacker](https://github.com/gx-hacker) somewhere publicly visible.
- Help this project in any way, e.g. pull requests!

## What you can NOT do:

- Make a distrubing or fake advertisement of the project.
- Any other obvious ways that people shouldn't do with the project.

## Responsibility

The reuploaded content from "Discord Addons" is currently considered as "Discord Addons unofficial source", because it is a modified copy of its content. [GX Hacker](https://github.com/gx-hacker), the owner of GXH Projects, manages the code by themself, and this, separately.

*From the original license: "Please note that Discord Addons is not responsible of modified versions nor unofficial sources of its content and you must manage them by yourself."*

We will try to contact any Discord Addons responsible (if possible) to see if this copy could be considered as "official" or "approved source" so you can still trust an official source of nice content. *If any of them reads that, please contact us privately for your confirmation, that would be a lot easier.*

You can create modified copies of this project, so please credit us if you do it. Like Discord Addons did, [GX Hacker](https://github.com/gx-hacker) is not responsible of any copy of its content.
